# Zhang Dong Architecture - Cursor Rules

You are an expert full-stack developer working on the website for Zhang Dong Architecture, featuring residential design services in the Bay Area and beyond.

## Project Overview
- **Purpose**: Static portfolio website showcasing residential design projects by Zhang Dong and his team
- **Tech Stack**: Next.js 16, React 19, Tailwind CSS
- **Architecture**: App Router, Server Components, Client Components (minimal API routes)
- **Design**: Benchmark design inspired by STL Architects (stlchicago.com)
- **Content**: Homepage and project showcase pages featuring past architectural work
- **Database**: None - all assets managed locally
- **Authentication**: None required - this is a public static portfolio site
- **UI**: Minimal, clean design with full-page images and high-contrast text

## Design Guidelines (Based on STL Architects Benchmark)

### Homepage
- Full-page HD image as background (use placeholder until actual image provided)
- Minimal design: logo on top-left, navigation menu button (+) on top-right
- Description text at bottom with manually picked high-contrast color
- **Important**: Text color must be manually picked for high contrast against the image
- No footer on homepage

### Navigation
- Click the "+" button (top-right) to open full-screen navigation menu
- Menu items: Projects, Profile (About), News, Contact
- Large, minimal typography for menu items

### Project Pages
- **IMPORTANT**: Each project has its own individual folder under `app/project/` with a dedicated `page.js` file
- **NO dynamic routing**: We do NOT use dynamic routes like `[slug]` or `[[...slug]]`
- URL structure matches folder structure: `/project/[project-name]` (e.g., `/project/demo-project-page`)
- Each project folder contains:
  - `page.js` - The page component for the project
  - `data.js` - Project data (title, description, images, team, etc.)
- Structure example:
  ```
  app/project/
    demo-project-page/
      page.js
      data.js
    another-project/
      page.js
      data.js
  ```
- Project page includes:
  - Main image at top
  - Project information (title, location, type, description)
  - Multiple images in sequence
  - Project Team section (text block)
  - Related Projects section at bottom
- To add a new project:
  1. Create folder: `app/project/[project-name]/`
  2. Create `data.js` with project data (export const project = { ... })
  3. Create `page.js` that imports from `./data` and renders the project
  4. Import the project in `libs/projects.js` to include it in listings

### Projects Listing Page
- Grid layout showing all projects
- Each project shows image, title, and location
- Projects are loaded from `libs/projects.js` which imports from individual project `data.js` files
- **When new projects are added**: 
  1. Create the project folder with `page.js` and `data.js` (see Project Pages above)
  2. Import the project data in `libs/projects.js`: `import { project as projectName } from "@/app/project/[project-name]/data"`
  3. Add it to the `projectModules` array in `libs/projects.js`

### Other Pages
- About page (`/about`) - Profile information
- News page (`/news`) - News and updates
- Contact page (`/contact`) - Contact information
- All pages except homepage show footer

### Footer
- Left side: Legal notice, Privacy policy, Cookies policy links
- Right side: LinkedIn icon (linked), Phone number, Email address
- Footer only shown on pages other than homepage

## Code Style & Conventions

### File Structure
- Use App Router structure (`app/` directory)
- API routes in `app/api/[endpoint]/route.js`
- Components in `components/` directory
- Utilities/libs in `libs/` directory
- Models in `models/` directory
- Configuration in `config.js`
- **Project pages**: Each project has its own folder under `app/project/[project-name]/` with `page.js` and `data.js`
- **NO dynamic routing**: Do not use `[slug]`, `[[...slug]]`, or other dynamic route segments for project pages

### Naming Conventions
- **Components**: PascalCase (e.g., `ButtonCheckout.js`, `HeaderBlog.js`)
- **API Routes**: kebab-case directories with `route.js` files
- **Utilities**: camelCase (e.g., `connectMongo`, `createCheckout`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
- **Variables**: camelCase

### Component Patterns
- Use `"use client"` directive for client components
- Import config from `@/config` for app-wide settings
- Use absolute imports with `@/` prefix
- Export default for single-purpose components
- Include descriptive comments for complex components

### API Route Structure
```javascript
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";

export async function POST(req) {
  try {
    const body = await req.json();
    
    // Validation
    if (!body.requiredField) {
      return NextResponse.json(
        { error: "Required field is missing" },
        { status: 400 }
      );
    }
    
    // Logic here (no authentication needed for static site)
    
    return NextResponse.json({ success: true });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    return NextResponse.json(
      { error: "Something went wrong" },
      { status: 500 }
    );
  }
}
```

### Authentication
- **No authentication required** - This is a static public portfolio website
- All pages are publicly accessible
- No user accounts, login, or admin areas needed
- API routes (if any) are for simple form submissions or static data only

### Content Management
- All assets (images, content) are managed locally in the `public/` directory
- No database required - content is static and stored in local files
- Content is edited directly in the codebase (project data files, page components)
- To update content: edit files directly, commit, and deploy

## Best Practices

### Error Handling
- Always wrap async operations in try-catch blocks
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes
- Log errors to console for debugging
- Provide user-friendly error messages

### Security
- Validate all inputs in API routes (if any)
- Use environment variables for any sensitive data (though minimal for static site)
- Implement proper CORS headers where needed
- Since this is a static site, security concerns are minimal

### Performance
- Use Server Components by default
- Only use Client Components when necessary (interactivity, hooks)
- Implement proper loading states
- Use Next.js Image component for optimized images
- Optimize static assets in `public/` directory

### UI/UX
- Use DaisyUI classes for consistent styling
- Implement loading states with DaisyUI spinners
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Ensure responsive design with Tailwind breakpoints
- Include proper accessibility attributes

## Environment Variables
No required environment variables for this static portfolio site.

Optional environment variables (only if adding features):
- `RESEND_API_KEY` - Resend email service API key (if adding contact form email functionality)
- `MONGODB_URI` - MongoDB connection string (only if adding database features in the future)
- Note: NextAuth is installed but not actively used - the route handler exists to prevent errors, but authentication is not required

## Common Patterns

### Client Component with API Call
```javascript
"use client";
import { useState } from "react";
import apiClient from "@/libs/api";

const ComponentName = () => {
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);
  
  const handleAction = async () => {
    setIsLoading(true);
    try {
      const response = await apiClient.post("/endpoint", data);
      // Handle success
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
    } finally {
      setIsLoading(false);
    }
  };
  
  return (
    <button 
      className="btn btn-primary"
      onClick={handleAction}
      disabled={isLoading}
    >
      {isLoading ? (
        <span className="loading loading-spinner loading-xs"></span>
      ) : (
        "Action"
      )}
    </button>
  );
};
```

### Static Content Pattern
```javascript
// Example: Project data file (app/project/[project-name]/data.js)
export const project = {
  title: "Project Name",
  location: "Location",
  type: "Residential",
  description: "Project description...",
  images: ["/images/project1.jpg", "/images/project2.jpg"],
  team: "Team information...",
};

// Example: Project page (app/project/[project-name]/page.js)
import { project } from "./data";

export default function ProjectPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{project.title}</h1>
      {/* Render project content */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Configuration
- All app configuration is centralized in `config.js`
- Use `config.appName`, `config.domainName`, etc. throughout the app
- Stripe plans are defined in `config.stripe.plans`
- Email settings in `config.resend`
- Theme settings in `config.colors`

## Testing & Development
- Use `npm run dev` for development
- Use `npm run build` for production builds
- Follow conventional commit messages
- Test all pages render correctly
- Verify images and assets load properly
- Test responsive design on different screen sizes

## Deployment Considerations
- Ensure all static assets are included in deployment
- No database setup required
- No authentication setup required
- Configure domain in `config.js`
- Optimize images before deployment for best performance
- All content is static - no server-side rendering needed for content pages

Remember to always check the existing codebase patterns before implementing new features to maintain consistency.
